The package gtest is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    enable_testing()
    
    find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main GTest::gmock GTest::gmock_main)
    
    add_test(AllTestsInMain main)

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(Tracy CONFIG REQUIRED)
